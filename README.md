# Folder-Filter
An easy step to filter any folder based on their extensions.

## Design
Used Graphical User Interface (GUI)

## Working
The user can provide with the path of any folder which has to be sorted/filtered. And also provide with path of a new folder to which it has to be filtered to. During execution, sub-folders will be created inside the new folder with the extension of files as their folder names. The files will then be moved into the sub-folders that have their extension as the folder names. If either of the path entered is invalid then it displays an invalid message and similarly displays a success message on successfully sorting the files.
